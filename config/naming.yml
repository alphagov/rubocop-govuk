# Conflicts with the original GDS styleguide

# While this may conflict with the original GDS styleguide, there
# are times where we wish to call a method that "sets" something.

# The original styleguide only accounts for a specific kind of "set"
# operation, where the argument is the value being assigned.

# We should be free to decide on interfaces that make sense to us.
# At the time of writing, this Cop is not auto-correctable, and
# would generate a prohibitively high number of issues across our

# This rule can cause readability issues when applied (for example
# `born_on_or_before_6_april_1935` becomes `born_on_or_before_6april1935`)
# and would require lots of amends to apply either `normalcase`
# or `snake_case` to projects. It is not auto-correctable.
