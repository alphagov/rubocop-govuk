# It's unclear what remedial action to take for the total
# set of methods this Cop has issues with. For example, we
# use 'update_all' in many of our repos, for which there is
# no efficient alternative. Instead, we should only enable
# this Cop for methods that have a clear alternative.

# While using has_many/through does have some advantages,
# it also requires a significant amount of boilerplate code:
#
# - An additional 'has_many :join_table' statement
# - An additional class for the join table (model)
#
# This Cop/rule appears to have been written with the
# assumption that all join tables have inherent meaning,
# we want to represent, which is not the case; sometimes
# relationships are just # many-to-many, and that's it.

# While using 'inverse_of' can reduce DB queries, we have
# not found this to be a problem in practice. The advantage
# of turning this on would be that we make the inverse
# behaviour explicit everywhere ActiveRecord can't apply it
# automatically, but this is rarely a surprise for developers.
# We also don't want to add 'inverse_of: false' everywhere;
# at the time of writing, there is no auto-correct for this.
Rails/InverseOf:
  Enabled: false

# This is incompatible with the more robust use of foreign
# key constraints, which provide the same behaviour.

# We commonly want to render HTML without escaping it, which
# is what 'html_safe' is for. In many cases, the content we
# render has already been sanitised (e.g. through Govspeak),
# or is otherwise trusted e.g. from a content item. We trust
# that developers will use 'html_safe' responsibly, and prefer
# the default, escaped output otherwise. At the time of writing,
# this Cop is disabled in a lot of repos, indicating it offers
# little value to many developers.
